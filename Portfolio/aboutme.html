  <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
  <p>I enjoy gaming on my PC with friends.I mostly play MOBA/RPG games.Dota 2 and CS-Go are some of my favorite games.</p>
  <p>Other than gaming, I listen to a lot of music and watch videos on youtube deciphering the meaning and the creation phase of that particular music.A media company named Genius does an excellent job presenting the hidden knowledge behind the music to
    the masses.</p>
