  <p>Hello Reader,I am <i>Sangay Yolmo</i>.And welcome to my first attempt at html.<span style="background-color:yellow;border:thin solid darkblue;">I am currently enrolled at <b>LaGuardia TechHire Program</b> learning Web Development.</p>

  <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
  <p>I have no prior background in Coding although I did enroll as a Computer Science major in college but could never make it through. </p>
  <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
  <p>I enjoy gaming on my PC with friends.I mostly play MOBA/RPG games.Dota 2 and CS-Go are some of my favorite games.</p>
  <p>Other than gaming, I listen to a lot of music and watch videos on youtube deciphering the meaning and the creation phase of that particular music.A media company named Genius does an excellent job presenting the hidden knowledge behind the music to
    the masses.</p>
